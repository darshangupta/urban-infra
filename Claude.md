# Urban-Infra: Multi-Agent Urban Planning System

**A comprehensive AI-powered tool for urban planning analysis in San Francisco neighborhoods using real data and constraint validation.**

---

## üèôÔ∏è Project Overview

Urban-Infra is a multi-agent system that answers complex urban planning questions like:
- *"What if we added affordable housing near BART in Hayes Valley?"*
- *"How can we make the Marina more walkable while respecting flood risks?"*  
- *"What zoning changes would prevent displacement in the Mission?"*

The system provides **concrete, implementable recommendations** backed by real SF zoning laws, demographic data, and spatial analysis.

## üéØ Target Neighborhoods

### Marina District
- **Characteristics**: Low density, waterfront, affluent
- **Zoning**: RH-1 (Residential House, One-Family)
- **Constraints**: Flood risk, limited transit, height restrictions
- **Planning Focus**: Climate resilience, walkability improvements

### Hayes Valley  
- **Characteristics**: Transit-rich, mixed-use, gentrifying
- **Zoning**: NCT-3 (Neighborhood Commercial Transit)  
- **Constraints**: Historic preservation, displacement pressure
- **Planning Focus**: Transit-oriented development, anti-displacement

### Mission District
- **Characteristics**: Dense, diverse, cultural significance
- **Zoning**: NCT-4 (High-density mixed-use)
- **Constraints**: Displacement risk, cultural preservation
- **Planning Focus**: Community-controlled development, equity

## üöÄ What We've Built (Completed)

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Foundation
- **Docker Environment**: PostGIS (port 5434) + Redis (port 6379)
- **Database**: Real SF neighborhood data loaded and queryable
- **API Server**: FastAPI with auto-generated docs at `/docs`
- **Testing**: Comprehensive constraint validation test suite (8/8 passing)

### ‚úÖ Real SF Data Integration
```bash
# Loaded and validated:
- SF Open Data Portal (zoning, parcels, demographics)
- Real zoning classifications (RH-1, RM-2, NCT-3, NCT-4)  
- Transit accessibility data (BART, Muni stops)
- Flood zones and seismic constraints
- Cultural asset locations and displacement risk indicators
```

### ‚úÖ Constraint Validation System
**Implements actual SF Planning Code rules:**
- Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limits by zone
- Height restrictions (40ft Marina, 85ft Mission corridors)
- Setback requirements and parking mandates
- Inclusionary housing percentages (12%-25% by zone)
- Ground floor commercial requirements in transit zones

**Example validation:**
```python
# Marina District proposal validation
validator.validate_zoning_proposal(
    zone_type=SFZoneType.RH_1,
    proposed_far=2.0,      # ‚ùå Exceeds 0.8 limit
    proposed_height_ft=60, # ‚ùå Exceeds 40ft limit
    num_units=8            # ‚úÖ Triggers inclusionary requirement
)
# Returns: violations with specific suggestions for compliance
```

### ‚úÖ Working API Endpoints
**Base URL**: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`

## ü§ñ 3-Agent System Architecture

### Agent 1: Interpreter
**Role**: Natural language ‚Üí Structured planning parameters
- **Input**: *"Add affordable housing near transit in Hayes Valley"*
- **Processing**: 
  - Identify neighborhood (Hayes Valley)
  - Extract intent (housing development)
  - Determine constraints (near transit, affordability focus)
  - Call neighborhood APIs for context
- **Output**: TwistPack with bounded parameters for planning

### Agent 2: Planner  
**Role**: Generate feasible development scenarios
- **Input**: TwistPack from Interpreter
- **Processing**:
  - Generate 3-5 candidate plans using constraint APIs
  - Each plan: specific FAR, height, amenity locations
  - Filter using `/validate-proposal` endpoint
  - Rank by feasibility and policy alignment
- **Output**: Feasible planning alternatives with rationale

### Agent 3: Evaluator
**Role**: Calculate before/after impact analysis  
- **Input**: Candidate plans from Planner
- **Processing**:
  - Use `/unit-estimates` for housing impact
  - Calculate accessibility changes (walk to amenities)
  - Assess equity implications (displacement, affordability)
  - Generate KPI dashboard with spatial metrics
- **Output**: Comprehensive impact analysis with recommendations

## üåç World Model Strategy

### Hybrid Approach: Real Constraints + Predictive Models

**Level 1: Deterministic (Implemented)**
- Real SF zoning laws (authoritative)
- Spatial calculations (distances, areas)
- Unit estimation based on actual SF development patterns

**Level 2: Lightweight Prediction (Planned)**  
- Pre-computed accessibility isochrones
- Housing market elasticity (price impacts)
- Demographic displacement risk scoring

**Level 3: Dynamic Simulation (Future)**
- Agent-based neighborhood modeling
- Economic gentrification effects
- Long-term spatial development patterns
