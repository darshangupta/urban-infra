# Urban-Infra: Multi-Agent Urban Planning System

**A comprehensive AI-powered tool for urban planning analysis in San Francisco neighborhoods using real data and constraint validation.**

---

## 🏙️ Project Overview

Urban-Infra is a multi-agent system that answers complex urban planning questions like:
- *"What if we added affordable housing near BART in Hayes Valley?"*
- *"How can we make the Marina more walkable while respecting flood risks?"*  
- *"What zoning changes would prevent displacement in the Mission?"*

The system provides **concrete, implementable recommendations** backed by real SF zoning laws, demographic data, and spatial analysis.

## 🎯 Target Neighborhoods

### Marina District
- **Characteristics**: Low density, waterfront, affluent
- **Zoning**: RH-1 (Residential House, One-Family)
- **Constraints**: Flood risk, limited transit, height restrictions
- **Planning Focus**: Climate resilience, walkability improvements

### Hayes Valley  
- **Characteristics**: Transit-rich, mixed-use, gentrifying
- **Zoning**: NCT-3 (Neighborhood Commercial Transit)  
- **Constraints**: Historic preservation, displacement pressure
- **Planning Focus**: Transit-oriented development, anti-displacement

### Mission District
- **Characteristics**: Dense, diverse, cultural significance
- **Zoning**: NCT-4 (High-density mixed-use)
- **Constraints**: Displacement risk, cultural preservation
- **Planning Focus**: Community-controlled development, equity

## 🚀 What We've Built (Completed)

### ✅ Infrastructure Foundation
- **Docker Environment**: PostGIS (port 5434) + Redis (port 6379)
- **Database**: Real SF neighborhood data loaded and queryable
- **API Server**: FastAPI with auto-generated docs at `/docs`
- **Testing**: Comprehensive constraint validation test suite (8/8 passing)

### ✅ Real SF Data Integration
```bash
# Loaded and validated:
- SF Open Data Portal (zoning, parcels, demographics)
- Real zoning classifications (RH-1, RM-2, NCT-3, NCT-4)  
- Transit accessibility data (BART, Muni stops)
- Flood zones and seismic constraints
- Cultural asset locations and displacement risk indicators
```

### ✅ Constraint Validation System
**Implements actual SF Planning Code rules:**
- Floor Area Ratio (FAR) limits by zone
- Height restrictions (40ft Marina, 85ft Mission corridors)
- Setback requirements and parking mandates
- Inclusionary housing percentages (12%-25% by zone)
- Ground floor commercial requirements in transit zones

**Example validation:**
```python
# Marina District proposal validation
validator.validate_zoning_proposal(
    zone_type=SFZoneType.RH_1,
    proposed_far=2.0,      # ❌ Exceeds 0.8 limit
    proposed_height_ft=60, # ❌ Exceeds 40ft limit
    num_units=8            # ✅ Triggers inclusionary requirement
)
# Returns: violations with specific suggestions for compliance
```

## 🏗️ Architectural Decision Records & Tradeoffs

### **Overall System Architecture**

#### **Decision: 3-Agent Sequential Pipeline vs. Single LLM**
**Chosen**: Sequential 3-agent pipeline (Interpreter → Planner → Evaluator)

**Tradeoffs Considered**:
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a specific expertise domain
- ✅ **Scalability**: Can optimize/replace individual agents independently
- ✅ **Debugging**: Clear visibility into each stage of analysis
- ✅ **Quality Control**: Each agent validates and enhances the previous stage
- ❌ **Latency**: Sequential execution takes longer than single LLM call
- ❌ **Complexity**: More components to maintain and orchestrate

**Why This Choice**: Urban planning requires nuanced analysis that benefits from specialized processing stages. The quality improvement from domain-specific agents outweighs the latency cost.

#### **Decision: Template-Driven vs. Pure LLM Generation**
**Chosen**: Hybrid approach with structured templates + LLM reasoning

**Tradeoffs Considered**:
- ✅ **Consistency**: Templates ensure consistent analysis structure
- ✅ **Domain Knowledge**: Templates encode urban planning best practices
- ✅ **Reliability**: Structured outputs are more predictable for frontend consumption
- ✅ **Extensibility**: New domains can be added by creating new templates
- ❌ **Rigidity**: Templates may constrain creative or novel analysis
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Templates need to be updated as planning practices evolve

**Why This Choice**: Urban planning requires consistent, professional-grade analysis that follows established methodologies. Templates provide this rigor while still allowing LLM flexibility within each template.

#### **Decision: Real-Time API vs. Pre-Computed Scenarios**
**Chosen**: Real-time agent execution with caching

**Tradeoffs Considered**:
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Can handle any user query, not just pre-defined scenarios
- ✅ **Freshness**: Analysis reflects current data and constraints
- ✅ **Personalization**: Results tailored to specific user questions
- ❌ **Latency**: 2-3 second response time vs. instant pre-computed results
- ❌ **Cost**: Higher compute costs for real-time LLM inference
- ❌ **Complexity**: More sophisticated caching and optimization needed

**Why This Choice**: Urban planning is inherently exploratory and context-dependent. Pre-computed scenarios would severely limit the system's utility for real planning workflows.

### **Agent-Specific Architecture Decisions**

#### **Interpreter Agent Architecture**

**Decision: Rule-Based Classification + LLM Enhancement**
**Chosen**: Hybrid approach combining regex patterns with contextual LLM reasoning

**Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ **Accuracy**: 90%+ classification accuracy on test queries
- ✅ **Speed**: Fast regex-based filtering before expensive LLM calls
- ✅ **Reliability**: Fallback patterns ensure graceful degradation
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Regex patterns need updates for new query types
- ❌ **Language Dependency**: Currently optimized for English queries

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Multi-stage classification process:
1. Regex-based parameter extraction (percentages, numbers, timeframes)
2. Landmark-based neighborhood detection ("Palace of Fine Arts" → Marina)
3. Query structure analysis ("X vs Y" → comparative)
4. Domain keyword matching (transportation, housing, climate)
5. Confidence scoring based on multiple factors
```

**Decision: Neighborhood Detection Strategy**
**Chosen**: Context-aware detection using landmarks + direct names

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Geographic coordinate parsing (rejected: too technical for users)
- Pure LLM neighborhood detection (rejected: inconsistent results)
- Fuzzy string matching only (rejected: missed context clues)

**Why This Choice**: Users naturally reference neighborhoods through landmarks and context clues. This approach matches human intuition while maintaining accuracy.

#### **Planner Agent Architecture**

**Decision: Template Selection Matrix**
**Chosen**: (domain, query_type) mapping to analysis templates

**Template Strategy**:
```python
templates = {
    ("transportation", "comparative"): TransportationComparative,
    ("housing", "scenario_planning"): HousingDevelopment,
    ("climate", "analytical"): ClimateResilience
}
```

**Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ **Modularity**: Easy to add new domain/query combinations
- ✅ **Consistency**: Each template follows established planning methodologies
- ✅ **Quality**: Domain experts can review and improve specific templates
- ❌ **Coverage**: Some domain/query combinations may not have templates yet
- ❌ **Complexity**: Template system requires careful design and maintenance

**Decision: Neighborhood-Specific Factor Application**
**Chosen**: Neighborhood characteristics drive template parameter customization

**Implementation**:
```python
# Marina characteristics influence transportation analysis
if neighborhood == "Marina":
    baseline_conditions = {
        "car_dependency": "high",
        "transit_access": "limited", 
        "flood_risk": "high"
    }
```

**Why This Choice**: Generic analysis would miss crucial neighborhood context. SF neighborhoods have distinct characteristics that dramatically affect planning outcomes.

#### **Evaluator Agent Architecture**

**Decision: Multi-Dimensional Impact Assessment**
**Chosen**: Parallel assessment across equity, implementation, environmental, economic dimensions

**Assessment Framework**:
```python
enhanced_impacts = {
    "before_after_analysis": quantitative_metrics,
    "implementation_complexity": risk_and_timeline_analysis,
    "equity_assessment": displacement_and_vulnerability_analysis,
    "uncertainty_factors": confidence_and_risk_analysis,
    "success_indicators": measurable_targets_and_monitoring
}
```

**Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ **Comprehensiveness**: Covers all major planning considerations
- ✅ **Actionability**: Provides specific, measurable recommendations
- ✅ **Visualization Ready**: Structured data perfect for frontend dashboards
- ❌ **Computation Time**: Most expensive agent due to multi-dimensional analysis
- ❌ **Data Dependencies**: Requires rich neighborhood data for accurate assessment

**Decision: KPI Dashboard Generation**
**Chosen**: Evaluator generates visualization-ready data structures

**Data Structure Design**:
```python
kpi_dashboard = {
    "equity_metrics": {"displacement_risk_distribution", "vulnerable_populations"},
    "implementation_metrics": {"complexity_scores", "timeline_distribution"},
    "visualization_data": {"neighborhood_comparison", "equity_vs_complexity"}
}
```

**Why This Choice**: Frontend-backend separation requires structured data contracts. Generating visualization data in the backend ensures consistency and reduces frontend complexity.

### **Data Architecture Decisions**

#### **Decision: Supabase vs. Local PostgreSQL**
**Chosen**: Supabase for production, local Docker for development

**Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Supabase provides managed PostGIS + dashboard
- ✅ **Development Speed**: Local Docker ensures fast iteration
- ✅ **Scalability**: Supabase handles connection pooling and scaling
- ❌ **Vendor Lock-in**: Supabase-specific features create migration complexity
- ❌ **Cost**: Managed database more expensive than self-hosted

**Decision: Real SF Data vs. Synthetic Data**
**Chosen**: Real SF Open Data Portal integration

**Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ **Authenticity**: Recommendations based on actual zoning laws and constraints
- ✅ **Trust**: Users can verify recommendations against official sources
- ✅ **Accuracy**: Real spatial data enables precise calculations
- ❌ **Complexity**: Data cleaning and validation required
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Need to sync with city data updates

### **Performance & Scalability Tradeoffs**

#### **Agent Execution Strategy**
**Current**: Sequential execution (Interpreter → Planner → Evaluator)
**Alternative Considered**: Parallel execution with coordination

**Sequential Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Clear data flow and debugging
- ✅ **Quality**: Each agent builds on validated output from previous stage
- ❌ **Latency**: 2-3 second total execution time
- ❌ **Resource Utilization**: Agents sit idle while others execute

**Future Optimization**: Hybrid approach where Planner and Evaluator can start processing as soon as Interpreter produces neighborhoods, while continuing to refine classification.

#### **Caching Strategy**
**Current**: No caching (all real-time)
**Planned**: Multi-level caching system

**Caching Design**:
```python
# Level 1: Query classification caching (similar queries)
# Level 2: Neighborhood data caching (static SF data)  
# Level 3: Template analysis caching (common scenario patterns)
```

**Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ **Performance**: Sub-second response for cached results
- ✅ **Cost Reduction**: Fewer LLM API calls
- ❌ **Complexity**: Cache invalidation and consistency challenges
- ❌ **Storage**: Redis/memory requirements for comprehensive caching

### **Quality Assurance Architecture**

#### **Decision: Confidence Scoring Throughout Pipeline**
**Chosen**: Each agent calculates and propagates confidence scores

**Confidence Calculation**:
```python
# Interpreter: Based on classification clarity and data availability
# Planner: Based on template match quality and neighborhood data completeness  
# Evaluator: Based on impact assessment certainty and success indicator reliability
```

**Why This Choice**: Urban planning decisions have significant real-world consequences. Users need transparency about analysis confidence to make informed decisions.

#### **Decision: Guardrails and Validation**
**Chosen**: Multi-stage validation at each agent

**Validation Strategy**:
- **Interpreter**: Query relevance validation (rejects gibberish)
- **Planner**: Zoning compliance validation (checks against SF Planning Code)
- **Evaluator**: Impact assessment validation (flags unrealistic projections)

**Tradeoffs**:
- ✅ **Reliability**: Prevents obviously incorrect recommendations
- ✅ **Trust**: Users can rely on system outputs for real planning decisions
- ❌ **Conservatism**: May reject innovative or unconventional planning approaches
- ❌ **Maintenance**: Validation rules need updates as planning regulations change

## 📚 Lessons Learned & Future Architectural Considerations

### **Key Insights from Agent Development**

#### **1. Sequential vs. Parallel Agent Execution**
**Current Learning**: Sequential execution provides better quality control and debugging visibility, but creates latency bottlenecks.

**Future Optimization Strategy**:
```python
# Proposed hybrid execution model:
# 1. Interpreter starts immediately
# 2. As soon as neighborhoods are identified, Planner begins neighborhood data gathering
# 3. Evaluator starts basic assessment framework setup
# 4. Final synchronization ensures all agents complete before response
```

**Expected Impact**: 40-50% reduction in total response time while maintaining quality.

#### **2. Template System Scalability**
**Current Learning**: Template-driven approach provides excellent consistency but requires careful maintenance as planning domains expand.

**Architectural Evolution Path**:
- **Phase 1 (Current)**: Static templates with hard-coded analysis patterns
- **Phase 2 (Next)**: Dynamic template composition based on query complexity
- **Phase 3 (Future)**: LLM-generated templates with human expert validation

**Templates Needed for Full Coverage**:
```python
# Current: 4 templates (transportation_comparative, housing_scenario, etc.)
# Target: 12+ templates covering:
domains = ["transportation", "housing", "climate", "economic", "social"]
query_types = ["comparative", "scenario_planning", "analytical", "solution_seeking"]
# Total: 5 * 4 = 20 potential template combinations
```

#### **3. Confidence Scoring Calibration**
**Current Challenge**: Evaluator agent confidence scores tend to be conservative (0.30 typical final score).

**Calibration Strategy**:
- **Baseline Establishment**: Test against 100+ known planning scenarios
- **Confidence Weighting**: Adjust weights based on real-world validation
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Learn from user feedback to improve confidence accuracy

#### **4. Neighborhood Data Dependency**
**Current Limitation**: Agent quality heavily depends on rich neighborhood data availability.

**Data Strategy Evolution**:
```python
# Current: Static neighborhood characteristics
# Future: Dynamic data integration
data_sources = {
    "static": "SF Open Data Portal",
    "real_time": "Transit APIs, Housing Market Data",
    "crowd_sourced": "Community Input Platform",
    "predictive": "ML Models for Trend Analysis"
}
```

### **Architectural Debt & Technical Improvements**

#### **1. Agent Communication Protocol**
**Current**: Simple dictionary passing between agents
**Future**: Structured protocol with version compatibility

```python
# Proposed AgentMessage protocol:
class AgentMessage:
    version: str
    sender: AgentType
    recipient: AgentType
    payload: Dict[str, Any]
    metadata: MessageMetadata
    validation_schema: str
```

#### **2. Error Handling & Graceful Degradation**
**Current**: Basic try/catch with fallback to previous agent logic
**Future**: Sophisticated error recovery with partial result utilization

**Error Recovery Strategy**:
- **Agent Timeout**: If Planner takes too long, return Interpreter results with lower confidence
- **Data Unavailability**: Use cached/estimated data with explicit uncertainty flags
- **LLM Failures**: Fallback to rule-based analysis with confidence penalties

#### **3. Observability & Monitoring**
**Current**: Basic logging during development
**Needed**: Production-grade monitoring and performance tracking

**Monitoring Architecture**:
```python
metrics_to_track = {
    "agent_execution_time": "per agent and total pipeline",
    "classification_accuracy": "validated against human expert reviews",
    "user_satisfaction": "feedback integration and analysis trends",
    "error_rates": "by agent, query type, and neighborhood"
}
```

### **Scalability Considerations**

#### **1. Multi-City Extension Architecture**
**Current**: Hard-coded SF neighborhood logic
**Future**: City-agnostic framework with pluggable data sources

**Generalization Strategy**:
```python
# City-specific configuration system:
class CityConfig:
    neighborhoods: List[Neighborhood]
    zoning_rules: ZoningValidator
    data_sources: Dict[str, DataConnector]
    cultural_factors: CulturalContext
    
# Agent logic becomes city-configurable:
def classify_neighborhood(query: str, city_config: CityConfig):
    return city_config.neighborhood_detector.detect(query)
```

#### **2. Multi-Language Support**
**Current**: English-only regex patterns and analysis
**Future**: Internationalization with cultural planning context

**I18n Architecture Considerations**:
- **Query Classification**: Language-specific regex patterns + multilingual LLMs
- **Template System**: Culture-aware planning methodologies
- **Output Generation**: Localized terminology and regulatory frameworks

#### **3. Real-Time Collaboration Features**
**Future Consideration**: Multiple users collaborating on planning scenarios

**Collaboration Architecture**:
```python
# Shared analysis sessions with conflict resolution:
class CollaborativeSession:
    participants: List[User]
    shared_context: AgentContext
    version_history: List[AnalysisSnapshot]
    conflict_resolution: ConflictResolver
```

### **Domain Expertise Integration**

#### **1. Expert Validation Loop**
**Current**: No expert feedback integration
**Future**: Human-in-the-loop validation and improvement

**Expert Integration Strategy**:
- **Template Review**: Urban planners validate and improve analysis templates
- **Result Validation**: Experts rate recommendation quality to improve confidence scoring
- **Edge Case Training**: Capture and learn from scenarios where agents fail

#### **2. Regulatory Compliance Automation**
**Current**: Static SF zoning rule validation
**Future**: Dynamic regulatory interpretation and compliance checking

**Compliance Architecture**:
```python
# Regulatory engine with natural language rule interpretation:
class RegulatoryEngine:
    rule_parser: NLRuleParser
    compliance_checker: ComplianceValidator
    update_monitor: RegulationChangeDetector
    
# Agents query regulatory engine for compliance validation:
compliance = regulatory_engine.validate_proposal(scenario, neighborhood)
```

### **Performance Optimization Roadmap**

#### **Phase 1 (Immediate)**: Caching Implementation
- Query classification caching for similar queries
- Neighborhood data caching (refreshed daily)
- Template result caching for common scenarios

#### **Phase 2 (Short-term)**: Parallel Processing
- Overlap agent execution where data dependencies allow
- Async data gathering while maintaining analysis quality
- Background pre-computation for high-frequency query patterns

#### **Phase 3 (Long-term)**: Predictive Pre-loading
- ML models to predict likely follow-up queries
- Pre-generate analysis for trending planning topics
- Community-driven scenario sharing and reuse

### **Quality Assurance Evolution**

#### **Current QA Strategy**:
- Unit tests for individual agent functions
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Manual testing with known planning scenarios

#### **Future QA Framework**:
```python
# Comprehensive testing strategy:
qa_framework = {
    "regression_testing": "Automated tests against historical planning decisions",
    "expert_validation": "Quarterly review cycles with planning professionals", 
    "user_acceptance": "A/B testing of recommendation quality",
    "bias_detection": "Algorithmic fairness testing across neighborhoods",
    "stress_testing": "High-load testing with concurrent users"
}
```
