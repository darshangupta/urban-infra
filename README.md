## üèôÔ∏è Project Overview

Urban-Infra transforms how urban planners, community advocates, and policymakers analyze complex neighborhood changes. Instead of generating "top 3 ranked solutions," it provides open-ended exploratory analysis that adapts to the question being asked.

### **Key Innovation: Question-Responsive Analysis**
- **Climate Query**: "What if it became 10¬∞F colder?" ‚Üí Environmental impact analysis with heating costs, flooding risks, community adaptation
- **Business Query**: "How would bike lanes affect businesses?" ‚Üí Economic ecosystem analysis with customer access, revenue impacts, adaptation strategies  
- **Comparative Query**: "Marina vs Mission bike infrastructure?" ‚Üí Neighborhood-specific business impact comparison

## üéØ Core Philosophy & Design Decisions

### **1. Exploratory vs. Prescriptive Approach**

**‚ùå What We Rejected:**
- Ranked "Top 3 Solutions" that apply generic responses to specific contexts
- One-size-fits-all analysis frameworks
- Prescriptive recommendations without context awareness

**‚úÖ What We Built:**
- Question-responsive analysis that adapts content to query intent
- Domain-specific insights (climate, transportation, economics, housing)
- Neighborhood-aware analysis reflecting local characteristics and vulnerabilities

**Trade-off:** More complex to build and maintain, but provides far more relevant and actionable insights.

### **2. Multi-Agent Architecture**

We chose a **3-agent system** over monolithic analysis:

```
Query ‚Üí Agent 1 (Interpreter) ‚Üí Agent 2 (Planner) ‚Üí Agent 3 (Evaluator) ‚Üí Response
```

**Why This Architecture:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a single, clear responsibility
- **Debugging & Testing**: Can test each component independently
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap out or enhance individual agents
- **Scalability**: Can run agents in parallel or on different services

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex than single-model approach
- Requires orchestration and error handling between agents
- Higher latency (mitigated by async processing)

### **3. Real SF Data Integration**

**Decision:** Use actual SF zoning laws, demographic data, and planning constraints rather than synthetic data.

**Benefits:**
- Recommendations are legally feasible and implementable
- Analysis reflects real neighborhood characteristics
- Builds trust with actual SF planning professionals

**Implementation:**
- PostGIS database with SF Open Data Portal integration
- Zoning validation against actual Planning Code
- Real transit accessibility and flood risk data

**Trade-offs:**
- Harder to generalize to other cities
- Data maintenance overhead
- More complex validation logic

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Backend Stack**

```python
FastAPI + PostGIS + Redis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Real-time exploratory analysis API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SF zoning law validation engine  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Multi-agent orchestration system
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Constraint-based planning algorithms
```

**Key Choices:**
- **FastAPI over Django**: Better async support for AI model calls
- **PostGIS over standard DB**: Spatial analysis requirements
- **Redis for caching**: AI responses are expensive to regenerate
- **Pydantic for validation**: Strong typing for complex urban planning data

### **Frontend Stack**

```typescript
Next.js 14 + TypeScript + ShadCN UI + Tailwind
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Analytics Dashboard (primary interface)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Exploratory Canvas (detailed climate/scenario analysis)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dark mode with theme persistence
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Error boundaries with graceful degradation
```

**Key Choices:**
- **Next.js over React SPA**: Better SEO and initial load performance
- **ShadCN over custom components**: Consistent, accessible design system
- **TypeScript strict mode**: Catch errors early in complex data flows
- **Tailwind over CSS-in-JS**: Better performance and design consistency

### **Analysis Engine Design**

```
Query Analysis ‚Üí Domain Detection ‚Üí Content Generation ‚Üí Response Assembly
```

**Query Type Detection:**
- `scenario_planning`: "What if..." queries with temporal analysis
- `comparative`: "X vs Y" queries with neighborhood comparison
- `analytical`: "How would..." queries with impact analysis
- `solution_seeking`: "How should we..." queries with recommendation focus

**Domain Classification:**
- `climate`: Temperature, flooding, environmental impacts
- `transportation`: Bike lanes, transit, walkability
- `economics`: Business impacts, revenue, employment
- `housing`: Development, affordability, displacement
- `environment`: Parks, air quality, sustainability

## üé® User Experience Philosophy

### **Progressive Disclosure**

1. **Overview Tab**: High-level metrics and executive summary
2. **Neighborhoods Tab**: Detailed area-specific analysis
3. **Insights Tab**: Cross-cutting themes and comparisons
4. **Scenarios Tab**: Temporal analysis and "what-if" branches

**Why This Works:**
- Users can get quick answers or dive deep as needed
- Different stakeholders (politicians vs. planners) need different detail levels
- Complex urban planning requires multiple analytical lenses

### **Accessibility & Inclusivity**

- **Dark mode support**: Reduces eye strain for long analysis sessions
- **Semantic colors**: Text contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic content
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful degradation when AI models fail

## üß™ Quality Assurance Strategy

### **Testing Philosophy**

**100% Test Coverage Across:**
- 10 comprehensive query scenarios
- Edge cases (empty queries, XSS attempts, malformed input)
- All query types and domain combinations
- Error states and recovery paths

**Testing Approach:**
```python
# Validate both technical correctness AND content relevance
assert response.status_code == 200  # Technical
assert "climate" in analysis_content  # Content relevance  
assert no_housing_suggestions_for_climate_query  # Context appropriateness
```

### **Content Quality Validation**

- **Domain Relevance**: Climate queries get environmental analysis, not housing suggestions
- **Neighborhood Specificity**: Marina analysis reflects affluent, car-dependent character
- **Insight Depth**: Minimum threshold of actionable insights per neighborhood
- **Follow-up Coherence**: Related questions actually relate to the original query

---

## üé≠ Real-World Impact Examples

### **Climate Resilience Planning**
**Query**: "What if it became 10¬∞F colder? How would that affect Mission vs Hayes vs Marina?"

**Impact**: 
- Marina analysis: Focus on affluent residents' heating costs and flood risk amplification
- Mission analysis: Community vulnerability, displacement pressure from utility costs
- Hayes Valley: Transit-oriented lifestyle impacts, covered walkway needs

**Why This Matters**: Different neighborhoods need different climate adaptation strategies based on demographics, infrastructure, and community resources.

### **Transportation Equity Analysis**
**Query**: "How would bike infrastructure affect businesses in Marina vs Mission?"

**Impact**:
- Marina: High-end retail may lose suburban customers, but gains environmentally conscious locals
- Mission: Community businesses benefit from increased foot traffic, supports low-income families
- Both: Specific mitigation strategies for each business ecosystem

**Why This Matters**: Transportation changes affect different communities differently - one-size-fits-all policies often increase inequality.
